  abstract = {Successive brief visual stimuli falling within a critical time interval are phenomenally simultaneous. This paper examines two models of perceptual sampling which purport to account for phenomenal simultaneity. The first is Stroud's (1955) theory that the sensory input is quantized into successive, discrete summation periods or ‘moments’ (the Discrete Moment Hypothesis). An alternative model which has not generally been considered represents the ‘moment’ as a continuous, running sample of the input (the Travelling Moment Hypothesis).             Two experiments on phenomenal simultaneity are reported which provide a critical test between these two hypotheses. The results were entirely incompatible with the discrete moment model, which is therefore rejected. The travelling moment model accounted well for the results. These also suggest a possible relation between the limits of phenomenal simultaneity and the critical duration of brightness summation.},

  abstract = {Recognition memory for sub-span digit sequences was investigated using Stern-berg's varied-set RT technique. Two experiments studied memory for sequences containing repetitions (e.g. 9 1 9 3) and observed faster recognition of repeated items. Experiment I also showed serial position effects with faster responding to more recent items. Neither of these effects is predicted by Sternberg's highspeed exhaustive scanning hypothesis. Several alternative hypotheses are considered, including two models based on the concept of trace strength, which appear to merit further investigation. A least squares analysis of 41 points between 1 and 9 lying on the function y = [loge x]2 yields a correlation coefficient of 0.998. A least squares analysis of 41 points between 1 and 9 lying on the function y = [loge x]2 yields a correlation coefficient of 0.998. Now at the University of Stirling, Stirling, Scotland.

  abstract = {It is proposed that the human brain is proactive in that it continuously generates predictions that anticipate the relevant future. In this proposal, analogies are derived from elementary information that is extracted rapidly from the input, to link that input with the representations that exist in memory. Finding an analogical link results in the generation of focused predictions via associative activation of representations that are relevant to this analogy, in the given context. Predictions in complex circumstances, such as social interactions, combine multiple analogies. Such predictions need not be created afresh in new situations, but rather rely on existing               scripts               in memory, which are the result of real as well as of previously imagined experiences. This cognitive neuroscience framework provides a new hypothesis with which to consider the purpose of memory, and can help explain a variety of phenomena, ranging from recognition to first impressions, and from the brain's ‘default mode’ to a host of mental disorders.},

Participants responded to location-based imperative stimuli. When two such stimuli appeared in each trial, the results suggest independent learning of the two sequences and the occurrence of intermanual transfer. Following extended practice in Experiment 2, transfer of acquired sequence knowledge was not complete. Also in Experiment 2, when only one stimulus appeared in each trial specifying the responses for both hands so that there was no basis for separate stimulus-stimulus or separate response-effect learning, independent sequence learning was again evident, but there was no intermanual transfer at all. These findings suggest the existence of two mechanisms of sequence learning, one hand-related stimulus-based and the other motor-based, with only the former allowing for intermanual transfer.},

  abstract = {Gestalt psychologists identified several stimulus properties thought to underlie visual grouping and figure/ground segmentation, and among those properties was common fate: the tendency to group together individual objects that move together in the same direction at the same speed. Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in visual grouping based on other timedependent sources of visual information, including synchronized changes in luminance, in motion direction, and in figure/ ground relations. These various sources of temporal grouping information can be subsumed under the rubric temporal structure. In this article, the authors review evidence bearing on the effectiveness of temporal structure in visual grouping. They start with an overview of evidence bearing on temporal acuity of human vision, covering studies dealing with temporal integration and temporal differentiation. They then summarize psychophysical studies dealing with figure/ground segregation based on temporal phase differences in deterministic and stochastic events. The authors conclude with a brief discussion of neurophysiological implications of these results.},

  abstract = {Presents a simulation study using a hartline-ratliff lateral inhibitory network, modified for application to mammals, with patterns having all of the key parameters of stimuli used in metacontrast experiments. Network activity elicited during the application of stimuli follows a monotonic masking function, but a u-shaped function results when activity both during and after stimulation is examined. The longer processing time needed for obtaining u-shaped functions reflects the higher response criterion necessary for obtaining this function psychophysically. Forward masking, simultaneous presentation, and backward masking conditions are illustrated. In addition, the model qualitatively explains mutual masking, decreasing effectiveness of masking with increasing interstimulus separation, and change to monotonic functions with stronger masking stimuli, and it makes some predictions. Metacontrast is interpreted as a handicap which the organism accepts in order to gain the advantages of stimulus processing by lateral inhibition. Psychophysical and physiological evidence is cited to support the model. (37 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In conflict tasks, the irrelevant stimulus attribute needs to be suppressed for the correct response to be produced. In the Simon task, earlier researchers have proposed that this suppression is the reason that, after an initial increase, the interference effect decreases for longer RTs, as reflected by late, negative-going delta plots. This view has been challenged by observations of positive-going delta plots, even for long RTs, in other conflict tasks, despite a similar necessity for suppression. For late negative-going delta plots to be interpreted as reflecting suppression, a necessary, although maybe not sufficient, condition is that similar patterns should be observed for other conflict tasks. We reasoned that a similar suppression could be present, but hidden, in the Eriksen flanker task. By recording and analyzing electromyograms of the muscles involved in response execution, we could compute delta plots separately for trials that elicited a subthreshold incorrect response activation (partial error). Late negative-going delta plots were observable on partial-error trials, although they were weaker than for the Simon task, reducing the impact of this inversion on the overall distribution. We further showed that this pattern is modulated by time pressure. Those results indicate that mechanisms leading to negative-going delta plots, similar to those observed in the Simon task, are also at play in the Eriksen task. The link between negative-going delta plots and executive online control is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Working memory is one of the most important topics of research in cognitive psychology. The cognitive revolution that introduced the computer metaphor to describe human cognitive functioning called for this system in charge of the temporary storage of incoming or retrieved information to permit its processing. In the past decades, one particular mechanism of maintenance, attentional refreshing, has attracted an increasing amount of interest in the field of working memory. However, this mechanism remains rather mysterious, and its functioning is conceived in very different ways across the literature. This article presents an up‐to‐date review on attentional refreshing through the joint effort of leading researchers in the domain. It highlights points of agreement and delineates future avenues of research.},

  abstract = {Visual size perception is highly context-dependent. In a series of experiments reported here, we demonstrated that the contextual modulation of visual size processing could occur independent of conscious awareness. Specifically, the Ebbinghaus illusion, which is mediated by lateral connections within the early visual processing stream, persisted even when the surrounding inducers were rendered invisible. Moreover, when the central target was initially interocularly suppressed, the identical target emerged from suppression faster when surrounded by small relative to large inducers, with the suppression time difference well predicted by the strength of the illusion. By contrast, there were no such subconscious contextual modulation effects associated with the Ponzo illusion, which largely relies on feedback projections to the early visual cortices. These results indicate that contextual information can modulate visual size perception without conscious awareness, and the dissociated modulation effects further suggest that subconscious contextual modulation takes place in the early visual processing stream and is largely independent of high-level feedback influences.},

  abstract = {A battery comprising 4 fluid reasoning tests as well as 13 working memory (WM) tasks that involved storage, recall, updating, binding, and executive control, was applied to 318 adults in order to evaluate the true relationship of reasoning ability and WM capacity (WMC) to insight problem solving, measured using 40 verbal, spatial, math, matchstick, and remote associates problems (insight problems). WMC predicted 51.8\% of variance in insight problem solving and virtually explained its almost isomorphic link to reasoning ability (84.6\% of shared variance). The strong link between WMC and insight pertained generally to most WM tasks and insight problems, was identical for problems solved with and without reported insight, was linear throughout the ability levels, and was not mediated by age, motivation, anxiety, psychoticism, and openness to experience. In contrast to popular views on the sudden and holistic nature of insight, the solving of insight problems results primarily from typical operations carried out by the basic WM mechanisms that are responsible for the maintenance, retrieval, transformation, and control of information in the broad range of intellectual tasks (including fluid reasoning). Little above and beyond WM is unique about insight. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine the pattern of activity of the prefrontal cortex during performance of subjects in a nonspatial working memory task. Subjects observed sequences of letters and responded whenever a letter repeated with exactly one nonidentical letter intervening. In a comparison task, subjects monitored similar sequences of letters for any occurrence of a single, prespecified target letter. Functional scanning was performed using a newly developed spiral scan image acquisition technique that provides high-resolution, multislice scanning at approximately five times the rate usually possible on conventional equipment (an average of one image per second). Using these methods, activation of the middle and inferior frontal gyri was reliably observed within individual subjects during performance of the working memory task relative to the comparison task. Effect sizes (2-4\%) closely approximated those that have been observed within primary sensory and motor cortices using similar fMRI techniques. Furthermore, activation increased and decreased with a time course that was highly consistent with the task manipulations. These findings corroborate the results of positron emission tomography studies, which suggest that the prefrontal cortex is engaged by tasks that rely on working memory. Furthermore, they demonstrate the applicability of newly developed fMRI techniques using conventional scanners to study the associative cortex in individual subjects. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {12 male college students responded to target letters H or S by squeezing dynamometers with the left and right hand. Targets could be surrounded by compatible (e.g., HHHHH) or incompatible noise (SSHSS) letters. Measures of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential and of correct and incorrect electromyographic (EMG) and squeeze activity were used to study stimulus evaluation and response-related processes. When incorrect squeeze activity was present, execution of the correct response was prolonged, indicating a process of response competition. This process occurred more often under incompatible noise conditions, which were also associated with a delayed P300. Thus, the noise/compatability manipulation influenced both stimulus evaluation and response competition processes. In contrast, a warning tone that preceded array presentation on half the trials increased response speed without influencing evaluation time. Data suggest that the latency and accuracy of overt behavioral responses are a function of (a) a response activation process controlled by an evaluation process that accumulates evidence gradually, (b) a response priming process that is independent of stimulus evaluation, and (c) a response competition process.

  abstract = {Sternberg’s paradigm is currently viewed as a typical short-term memory task and is widely used to tap mnemonic capacities in neuroscience studies. However, Sternberg’s original procedure includes an experimental constraint – recalling the sequence of digits in order – which was not reused in the following studies. In previous research (Corbin \& Marquer, 2008, 2009), we showed that the recall constraint has an impact on the quantitative results as well as on the strategies implemented. These findings led us to wonder whether the presence or absence of this simple experimental constraint could also affect the processes implemented in Sternberg’s task. In order to answer this question, we analyzed the relationships between the performance levels of 50 participants on Sternberg’s task on various well-known span tasks and on a classical visual search task. The results showed that, in the recall condition, Sternberg’s paradigm appears to be a verbal working memory task, whereas in the no-recall condition, the task appears to be a recognition task that involves visuospatial memory capacities. In this latter condition, the processes implemented may be more similar to those implemented in visual search tasks.},

  abstract = {Motion-position illusions (MPIs) are visual motion illusions in which motion signals bias the perceived position of an object. Due to phenomenological similarities between these illusions, previous research has assumed that some are caused by common mechanisms. However, this assumption has yet to be directly tested. This study investigates this assumption by exploiting between-participant variations in illusion magnitude. During two sessions, 106 participants viewed the flash-lag effect, luminance flash-lag effect, Fröhlich effect, flash-drag effect, flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, twinkle-goes effect, and the flash-jump effect. For each effect, the magnitude of the illusion was reliable within participants, strongly correlating between sessions. When the pairwise correlations of averaged illusions magnitudes were explored, two clusters of statistically significant positively correlated illusions were identified. The first cluster comprised the flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, and twinkle-goes effect. The second cluster comprised the Fröhlich and flash-drag effect. The fact that within each of these two clusters, individual differences in illusion magnitude were correlated suggests that these clusters may reflect shared underlying mechanisms. An exploratory factor analysis provided additional evidence that these correlated clusters shared an underlying factor, with each cluster loading onto their own factor. Overall, our results reveal that, contrary to the prevailing perspective in the literature, while some motion-position illusions share processes, most of these illusions are unlikely to reflect any shared processes, instead implicating unique mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Common factors are ubiquitous. For example, there is a common factor, g, for intelligence. In vision, there is much weaker evidence for such common factors. For example, visual illusion magnitudes correlate only weakly with each other. Here, we investigated whether illusions are hyper-specific as in perceptual learning. First, we tested 19 variants of the Ebbinghaus illusion that differed in color, shape, or texture. Correlations between the illusion magnitudes of the different variants were mostly significant. Second, we reanalyzed a dataset from a previous experiment where 10 illusions were tested under four conditions of luminance and found significant correlations between the different luminance conditions of each illusion. However, there were only very weak correlations between the 10 different illusions. Third, five visual illusions were tested with four orientations. Again, there were significant correlations between the four orientations of each illusion, but not across different illusions. The weak inter-illusion correlations suggest that there is no unique common mechanism for the tested illusions. We suggest that most illusions make up their own factor.},

The correlation method, for its part, can study what man has not learned to control or can never hope to control… . A true federation of the disciplines is required.

Correlational psychology studies only variance among organisms; experimental psychology studies only variance among treatments. A united discipline will study both of these, but it will also be concerned with the otherwise neglected interactions between organismic and treatment variables.

  abstract = {Abstract             The negative priming (NP) effect refers to the observed increase in identification time for a current target stimulus or stimulus feature (the “probe”) that has been employed as a distractor stimulus or stimulus feature on the previous trial (the “prime”), representing strong evidence that ignored information is actively processed to a high level by selective attention systems. However, theoretical accounts of NP differ in whether they attribute the effect to processes of selective inhibition or episodic memory retrieval. Here we derived neurophysiological predictions from the rival “selective inhibition” and “episodic retrieval” models of NP, and employed event-related fMRI in a color-naming Stroop task to assess neural responses to probe trials that were subject to either no priming or negative priming. Compared to no-priming probe trials, NP resulted in increased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a region which has been closely linked with episodic memory retrieval functions. NP was also accompanied by activation of the right thalamus, particularly the mediodorsal nucleus, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a condition associated with diminished NP effects. Our results support the proposal that ignored stimulus information is fully encoded in memory, and that episodic retrieval, not selective inhibition, of such information affects selective attention performance on subsequent trials.},

Now in its thoroughly revised second edition, "Social Cognition" goes even further in organizing and critically evaluating the theories, evidence, and practical applications centered around the basic issue of how people make sense of their social environment. By combining new developments in cognitive psychology on attention, memory, and inference, with those emerging from the study of attitudes, affect, and motivation, Fiske and Taylor give us the "state of the art" manual for appreciating that aspect of human nature which focuses on how people think about themselves and about others.

  abstract = {Occasionally, experimental psychologists enter into the realm of psychometrics without being fully aware of the risks involved in the study of individual differences. Here we re-assess the many studies on location probability learning that suggest that people can unconsciously learn to suppress salient but irrelevant distractors frequently presented in a certain location. In the additional singleton task, one of the arguments to support this claim is that suppression in search times does not significantly differ between “aware” and “unaware” participants. Although rarely acknowledged, this null interaction could also result if the data are contaminated by measurement and/or sampling noise. Unfortunately, the reliability of the awareness measure cannot be assessed with standard methods, since it is a single-trial test. In the present study we offer model-based estimations of measurement and sampling noise in empirical data. Our goal is to determine how often researchers would mistakenly conclude that learning is unconscious, given data from a model based on the opposite claim (i.e., that learning is conscious) but including noise in participants’ search times and awareness responses. To do so, we fitted this noisy conscious model to a public dataset involving 159 participants who performed the additional singleton task. Estimated parameters from this model were used, first, to predict the observed pattern of results and, second, to simulate new responses and participants. Results suggest that, under reasonable measurement noise and sample sizes, simulated evidence from the model can paradoxically but falsely support arguments used to defend the unconscious learning hypothesis. This study serves as an illustration to experimental psychologists of the risks of neglecting basic psychometric requirements in individual differences research.},

  abstract = {Masked audiograms were studied as a function of the bandwidth, level, and frequency of a masking noise. In a reverse procedure, audiograms were determined when a movable, narrow, and approximately rectangular band of noise was used as signal in the presence of one or more masking tones. In both cases changes in the masked audiograms as a function of bandwidth made it possible to measure critical bandwidth. When masked audiograms were studied as a function of level, discontinuous changes in their height and shape occurred when the masking stimulus reached a certain “transition” level. If masking noises of subcritical or critical width were used, the growth of masking with level contained a discontinuity at a level of the masking stimulus equal to about 50 db SL. An abrupt change in the shape of the masked audiograms occurred at the same level. The change of shape when a pure tone was the masking stimulus consisted in the appearance of a “notch” one critical bandwidth above the frequency of the masking tone. Findings associated with the bandwidth parameter suggest interpretations of the critical band and of masking. The changes occurring at the transition level may indicate the threshold of the inner haircells.},

  abstract = {In cognition, audition, and somatosensation, performance strongly correlates between different paradigms, which suggests the existence of common factors. In contrast, visual performance in seemingly very similar tasks, such as visual and bisection acuity, are hardly related, i.e., pairwise correlations between performance levels are low even though test-retest reliability is high. Here we show similar results for visual illusions. Consistent with previous findings, we found significant correlations between the illusion magnitude of the Ebbinghaus and Ponzo illusions, but this relationship was the only significant correlation out of 15 further comparisons. Similarly, we found a significant link for the Ponzo illusion with both mental imagery and cognitive disorganization. However, most other correlations between illusions and personality were not significant. The findings suggest that vision is highly specific, i.e., there is no common factor. While this proposal does not exclude strong and stable associations between certain illusions and between certain illusions and personality traits, these associations seem to be the exception rather than the rule.},

  abstract = {Measurement efficiency is of concern when a large number of observations are required to obtain reliable estimates for parametric models of vision. The standard entropy-based Bayesian adaptive testing procedures addressed the issue by selecting the most informative stimulus in sequential experimental trials. Noninformative, diffuse priors were commonly used in those tests. Hierarchical adaptive design optimization (HADO; Kim, Pitt, Lu, Steyvers, \&amp; Myung, 2014) further improves the efficiency of the standard Bayesian adaptive testing procedures by constructing an informative prior using data from observers who have already participated in the experiment. The present study represents an empirical validation of HADO in estimating the human contrast sensitivity function. The results show that HADO significantly improves the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates, and therefore requires many fewer observations to obtain reliable inference about contrast sensitivity, compared to the method of quick contrast sensitivity function (Lesmes, Lu, Baek, \&amp; Albright, 2010), which uses the standard Bayesian procedure. The improvement with HADO was maintained even when the prior was constructed from heterogeneous populations or a relatively small number of observers. These results of this case study support the conclusion that HADO can be used in Bayesian adaptive testing by replacing noninformative, diffuse priors with statistically justified informative priors without introducing unwanted bias.},

  abstract = {Invariant item ordering refers to the statement that if one item is harder than another for one person, then it is harder for all people. Whether item ordering holds is a psychological statement because it describes how people may qualitatively vary. Yet, modern item response theory (IRT) makes an a priori commitment to item ordering. The Rasch model, for example, posits that items must order. Conversely, the 2PL model posits that items never order. Needed is an IRT model where item ordering or its violation is a function of the data rather than an a priori commitment. We develop two-parameter shift-scale models for this purpose, and find that the two-parameter uniform offers many advantages. We show how item ordering may be assessed using Bayes factor model comparison, and discuss computational issues with shift-scale IRT models.},

Current data sharing efforts are well suited for the first goal; yet, they do not sufficiently address the second goal. Here, we show how structured collections of open data can be useful as they allow a larger community of researchers easy access to a large body of data from their own research area. We introduce the Attentional Control Data Collection, an SQL data base for attentional control experiments. We illustrate the structure of the data base, how it can be easily accessed using a shiny app and an R-package, and how researchers can contribute data from their studies to the data base. Finally, we conduct our own initial analysis of the 64 data sets in our data base, assessing the reliability of individual differences. The analysis highlights that reliability is generally low, and provides insights into planning future studies. For example researchers should consider to increase the number of trials per person and condition to at least 400. The analysis highlights how an open data base like ACDC can aid meta-analytic efforts as well as methodological innovation.},

  abstract = {Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are a class of measurement models that account for categorical data by assuming a finite number of underlying cognitive processes. Traditionally, data are aggregated across participants and analyzed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed observations. Hierarchical Bayesian extensions of MPT models explicitly account for participant heterogeneity by assuming that the individual parameters follow a continuous hierarchical distribution. We provide an accessible introduction to hierarchical MPT modeling and present the user-friendly and comprehensive R package TreeBUGS, which implements the two most important hierarchical MPT approaches for participant heterogeneity—the beta-MPT approach (Smith \& Batchelder, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 54:167-183, 2010) and the latent-trait MPT approach (Klauer, Psychometrika 75:70-98, 2010). TreeBUGS reads standard MPT model files and obtains Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples that approximate the posterior distribution. The functionality and output are tailored to the specific needs of MPT modelers and provide tests for the homogeneity of items and participants, individual and group parameter estimates, fit statistics, and within- and between-subjects comparisons, as well as goodness-of-fit and summary plots. We also propose and implement novel statistical extensions to include continuous and discrete predictors (as either fixed or random effects) in the latent-trait MPT model.},

  abstract = {A family of prior distributions for covariance matrices is studied. Members of the family possess the attractive property of all standard deviation and correlation parameters being marginally noninformative for particular hyperparameter choices. Moreover, the family is quite simple and, for approximate Bayesian inference techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean field variational Bayes, has tractability on par with the Inverse-Wishart conjugate family of prior distributions. A simulation study shows that the new prior distributions can lead to more accurate sparse covariance matrix estimation.},

  abstract = {LASSO is a popular statistical tool often used in conjunction with generalized linear models that can simultaneously select variables and estimate parameters. When there are many variables of interest, as in current biological and biomedical studies, the power of LASSO can be limited. Fortunately, so much biological and biomedical data have been collected and they may contain useful information about the importance of certain variables. This article proposes an extension of LASSO, namely, prior LASSO (pLASSO), to incorporate that prior information into penalized generalized linear models. The goal is achieved by adding in the LASSO criterion function an additional measure of the discrepancy between the prior information and the model. For linear regression, the whole solution path of the pLASSO estimator can be found with a procedure similar to the least angle regression (LARS). Asymptotic theories and simulation results show that pLASSO provides significant improvement over LASSO when the prior information is relatively accurate. When the prior information is less reliable, pLASSO shows great robustness to the misspecification. We illustrate the application of pLASSO using a real dataset from a genome-wide association study. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {We propose source-space independent component analysis (ICA) for separation, tomography, and time-course reconstruction of EEG and MEG source signals. Source-space ICA is based on the application of singular value decomposition and ICA on the neuroelectrical signals from all brain voxels obtained post minimum-variance beamforming of sensor-space EEG or MEG. We describe the theoretical background and equations, then evaluate the performance of this technique in several different situations, including weak sources, bilateral correlated sources, multiple sources, and cluster sources. In this approach, tomographic maps of sources are obtained by back-projection of the ICA mixing coefficients into the source-space (3-D brain template). The advantages of source-space ICA over the popular alternative approaches of sensor-space ICA together with dipole fitting and power mapping via minimum-variance beamforming are demonstrated. Simulated EEG data were produced by forward head modeling to project the simulated sources onto scalp sensors, then superimposed on real EEG background. To illustrate the application of source-space ICA to real EEG source reconstruction, we show the localization and time-course reconstruction of visual evoked potentials. Source-space ICA is superior to the minimum-variance beamforming in the reconstruction of multiple weak and strong sources, as ICA allows weak sources to be identified and reconstructed in the presence of stronger sources. Source-space ICA is also superior to sensor-space ICA on accuracy of localization of sources, as source-space ICA applies ICA to the time-courses of voxels reconstructed from minimum-variance beamforming on a 3D scanning grid and these time-courses are optimally unmixed via the beamformer. Each component identified by source-space ICA has its own tomographic map which shows the extent to which each voxel has contributed to that component.},

The strategy of mental rotation featured in many recent experiments uses a coordinate system defined by the standard axes of the human visual world (i.e., horizontal, vertical, and depth axes). Several other possible coordinate systems for solving the problems that occur in psychometric tests of spatial ability are examined. One alternative strategy uses a coordinate system defined by the demands of each test item, resulting in mental rotation around arbitrary, task-defined axes. Another strategy uses a coordinate system defined exclusively by the objects, producing representations invariant with the objects' orientation. Three experiments with 31 university students were conducted to assess differences in strategies used by Ss with high or low spatial ability in cube comparison and Shepard-Metzler (R. Shepard and J. Metzler; see record 1972-28060-001) rotation tasks. Two computer simulation models based on Ss' performance patterns are described. It is suggested that Ss high in spatial ability are faster in their manipulation processes and more flexible in adopting cognitive coordinate systems than their low-ability counterparts.

  abstract = {Directing visual attention toward a particular feature or location in the environment suppresses processing of nearby stimuli [1, 2, 3, 4]. Echoing the center-surround organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields [5], and biasing of competitive local neuronal dynamics in favor of task-relevant stimuli [6], this “inhibitory surround” attention mechanism accentuates the demarcation between task-relevant and irrelevant items. Here, we show that internally maintaining a color stimulus in working memory (WM), rather than visually attending the stimulus in the external environment, produces an analogous pattern of inhibition for stimuli that are nearby in color space. Replicating a well-known effect of attentional capture by stimuli that match WM content [7], visual attention was biased toward (task-irrelevant) stimuli that exactly matched a WM item. This bias was curtailed, however, for stimuli that were very similar to the WM~content (i.e., within the inhibitory zone surrounding the focus of WM) and recovered for less similar stimuli (i.e., beyond the bounds of the inhibitory surround). Moreover, the expression of this inhibition effect was positively associated with WM performance across observers. In a second experiment, inhibition also occurred between two similar items simultaneously held in WM. This suggests that maintenance in WM is characterized by an excitatory peak centered on the focus of (internal) attention, surrounded by an inhibitory zone to limit interference by irrelevant and confusable representations. Here, thus, we show for the first time that the same center-surround selection mechanism that focuses visual attention on sensory stimuli also selectively maintains internally activated representations in WM.},

  abstract = {For missing data problems, Tanner and Wong have described a data augmentation procedure that approximates the actual posterior distribution of the parameter vector by a mixture of complete data posteriors. Their method of constructing the complete data sets is closely related to the Gibbs sampler. Both required iterations, and, similar to the EM algorithm, convergence can be slow. We introduce in this article an alternative procedure that involves imputing the missing data sequentially and computing appropriate importance sampling weights. In many applications this new procedure works very well without the need for iterations. Sensitivity analysis, influence analysis, and updating with new data can be performed cheaply. Bayesian prediction and model selection can also be incorporated. Examples taken from a wide range of applications are used for illustration.}

  abstract = {In five experiments we compared prosaccade and antisaccade performance in normal human observers. This was first examined for visual stimulation in temporal or nasal hemifields, under monocular viewing. Prosaccades were faster following temporal than nasal stimulation, in accordance with previous results. The novel finding was that the opposite pattern was observed for antisaccades, consistent with a difficulty in overcoming a stronger prosaccade tendency after temporal-hemifield stimulation. A second experiment showed that these results were not simply due to antisaccades following nasal stimulation benefitting from being made towards a temporal place-holder. Prosaccades and antisaccades were then compared for visual versus somatosensory stimulation. The substantial latency difference between prosaccades and antisaccades for visual stimuli was eliminated for somatosensory stimuli. Antisaccades can thus benefit in relative terms when the competing prosaccadic tendency is weakened; but two further experiments revealed that not all manipulations induce opposing outcomes for the two types of saccade. Although reducing the contrast of visual targets can slow prosaccades and conversely speed antisaccades, this was not the case at the lowest contrast level used, where both types of saccade were slowed, thus indicating some common limiting source. Moreover, warning sounds presented shortly before a visual target speeded both prosaccades and antisaccades. These results illustrate that several factors which slow prosaccades can speed antisaccades (consistent with competition between different pathways); but also reveal some notable exceptions, where both types of saccade are slowed or speeded together, suggesting some common pathways that may precede competition over the direction of the saccade.},

  abstract = {Methods for analyzing unbalanced factorial designs can be traced back to Yates (1934). Today, most major statistical programs perform, by default, unbalanced ANOVA based on Type III sums of squares (Yates's weighted squares of means). As criticized by Nelder and Lane (1995), this analysis is founded on unrealistic models—models with interactions, but without all corresponding main effects. The Type II analysis (Yates's method of fitting constants) is usually not preferred because of the underlying assumption of no interactions. This argument is, however, also founded on unrealistic models. Furthermore, by considering the power of the two methods, it is clear that Type II is preferable.},

  abstract = {Several previous studies reported relationships between speed of information processing as measured with the drift parameter of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) and general intelligence. Most of these studies utilized only few tasks and none of them used more complex tasks. In contrast, our study (N = 125) was based on a large battery of 18 different response time tasks that varied both in content (numeric, figural, and verbal) and complexity (fast tasks with mean RTs of ca. 600 ms vs. more complex tasks with mean RTs of ca. 3,000 ms). Structural equation models indicated a strong relationship between a domain-general drift factor and general intelligence. Beyond that, domain-specific speed of information processing factors were closely related to the respective domain scores of the intelligence test. Furthermore, speed of information processing in the more complex tasks explained additional variance in general intelligence. In addition to these theoretically relevant findings, our study also makes methodological contributions showing that there are meaningful interindividual differences in content specific drift rates and that not only fast tasks, but also more complex tasks can be modeled with the diffusion model.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Motivated by Signal Detection Theory (SDT), we developed a family of novel adaptive methods that estimate the sensitivity threshold—the signal intensity corresponding to a pre-defined sensitivity level ({$<$}italic{$>$}d{$<$}/italic{$>$}′ = 1)—in {$<$}italic{$>$}Yes-No{$<$}/italic{$>$} (YN) and {$<$}italic{$>$}Forced-Choice{$<$}/italic{$>$} (FC) detection tasks. Rather than focus stimulus sampling to estimate a single level of {$<$}italic{$>\%$}Yes{$<$}/italic{$>$} or {$<$}italic{$>\%$}Correct{$<$}/italic{$>$}, the current methods sample psychometric functions more broadly, to concurrently estimate sensitivity and decision factors, and thereby estimate thresholds that are independent of decision confounds. Developed for four tasks—(1) {$<$}italic{$>$}simple YN detection{$<$}/italic{$>$}, (2) {$<$}italic{$>$}cued YN detection{$<$}/italic{$>$}, which cues the observer's response state before each trial, (3) {$<$}italic{$>$}rated YN detection{$<$}/italic{$>$}, which incorporates a {$<$}italic{$>$}Not Sure{$<$}/italic{$>$} response, and (4) {$<$}italic{$>$}FC detection{$<$}/italic{$>$}—the {$<$}italic{$>$}qYN{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}qFC{$<$}/italic{$>$} methods yield sensitivity thresholds that are independent of the task's decision structure ({$<$}italic{$>$}YN{$<$}/italic{$>$} or {$<$}italic{$>$}FC{$<$}/italic{$>$}) and/or the observer's subjective response state. Results from simulation and psychophysics suggest that 25 trials (and sometimes less) are sufficient to estimate {$<$}italic{$>$}YN{$<$}/italic{$>$} thresholds with reasonable precision (s.d. = 0.10–0.15 decimal log units), but more trials are needed for {$<$}italic{$>$}FC{$<$}/italic{$>$} thresholds. When the same subjects were tested across tasks of simple, cued, rated, and FC detection, adaptive threshold estimates exhibited excellent agreement with the method of constant stimuli (MCS), and with each other. These {$<$}italic{$>$}YN{$<$}/italic{$>$} adaptive methods deliver criterion-free thresholds that have previously been exclusive to {$<$}italic{$>$}FC{$<$}/italic{$>$} methods.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {There is an ongoing debate about the unity and diversity of executive functions and their relationship with other cognitive abilities such as processing speed, working memory capacity, and intelligence. Specifically, the initially proposed unity and diversity of executive functions is challenged by discussions about (1) the factorial structure of executive functions and (2) unfavorable psychometric properties of measures of executive functions. The present study addressed two methodological limitations of previous work that may explain conflicting results: The inconsistent use of (a) accuracy-based vs. reaction time-based indicators and (b) average performance vs. difference scores. In a sample of 148 participants who completed a battery of executive function tasks, we tried to replicate the three-factor model of the three commonly distinguished executive functions shifting, updating, and inhibition by adopting data-analytical choices of previous work. After addressing the identified methodological limitations using drift–diffusion modeling, we only found one common factor of executive functions that was fully accounted for by individual differences in the speed of information uptake. No variance specific to executive functions remained. Our results suggest that individual differences common to all executive function tasks measure nothing more than individual differences in the speed of information uptake. We therefore suggest refraining from using typical executive function tasks to study substantial research questions, as these tasks are not valid for measuring individual differences in executive functions.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces JASP, a free graphical software package for basic statistical procedures such as t tests, ANOVAs, linear regression models, and analyses of contingency tables. JASP is open-source and differentiates itself from existing open-source solutions in two ways. First, JASP provides several innovations in user interface design; specifically, results are provided immediately as the user makes changes to options, output is attractive, minimalist, and designed around the principle of progressive disclosure, and analyses can be peer reviewed without requiring a "syntax". Second, JASP provides some of the recent developments in Bayesian hypothesis testing and Bayesian parameter estimation. The ease with which these relatively complex Bayesian techniques are available in JASP encourages their broader adoption and furthers a more inclusive statistical reporting practice. The JASP analyses are implemented in R and a series of R packages.},

  abstract = {Visual illusions are a gateway to understand how we construct our experience of reality. Unfortunately, important questions remain open, such as the hypothesis of a common factor underlying the sensitivity to different types of illusions, as well as of personality correlates of illusion sensitivity. In this study, we used a novel parametric framework for visual illusions to generate 10 different classic illusions (Delboeuf, Ebbinghaus, Rod and Frame, Vertical-Horizontal, Zöllner, White, Müller-Lyer, Ponzo, Poggendorff, Contrast) varying in strength, embedded in a perceptual discrimination task. We tested the objective effect of the illusions on errors and response times, and extracted participant-level performance scores (n=250) for each illusion. Our results provide evidence in favour of a general factor underlying the sensitivity to different illusions (labelled Factor i). Moreover, we report a positive link between illusion sensitivity and personality traits such as Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility, and negative relationships with Psychoticism, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Negative Affect.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments determined how the latency of a dark-adapted observer's response varies with flash luminance and flash duration. Upon receipt of a flash, observers responded by releasing a contact switch. Latency varied as a power function of luminance with simple fractional exponents: an exponent of − 1/3 for extended sources and an exponent of − ½ for a point source. To a first approximation, the exponents were independent of flash duration, spectral composition, or retinal location. Both photopic and scotopic processes gave rise to latency functions with similar exponents. For brief flashes under all stimulus conditions examined, latency was determined by the stimulus energy contained in the first 10 msec of the flash independent of flash luminance level. The invariance of the period of temporal dependence indicates a linear process in latency determination. Résumé Onétudie au moyen d'une série d'expériences la variation de la latence d'un observateur adaptéàl'obscuritéen réponseàdeséclairs de luminance et de durées diverses. A la réception d'unéclair, les sujets répondent en laˆchant un contact. La latence varie commen une puissance de la limunance avec des exposants qui sont des fractions simples: − 1/3 pour des sourcesétendues et − ½ pour des sources ponctuelles. En première approximation les exposants sont indépendants de la durée de l'éclair, de sa composition spectrale et de la région rétinienne. Les processus photopique et scotopique donnent tous deux des fonctions de latence avec des exposants semblables. Pour deséclairs brefs sous toutes les conditions de stimulus examinées, la latence est déterminée par l'énergie du stimulus contenue dans les 10 premières msec de l'éclair, indépendamment de son niveau de luminance. L'invariance de la période de dépendance temporelle indique un processus linéaire dans la détermination de la latence. Zusammenfassung In einer Reihe von Experimenten wurde bestimmt, wie sich die Latenzzeit eines dunkeladaptierten Beobachters mit der Leuchtdichte und der Dauer eines Blitzesändert. Die Versuchspersonen antworteten bei der Wahrnehmung eines Blitzes durch Betätigung eines Kontaktes. Die Latenzzeitändert sich als Potenzfunktion der Leuchtdichte. Es ergibt sich für ausgedehnte Lichtquellen ein Exponent von − 1/3 und für Punktlichtquellen einer von − ½. In erster Näherung sind die Exponenten unabhängig von der Dauer und der spektralen Zusammensetzung des Blitzes und vom Netzhautort. Sowohl platopische als auch skotopische Prozesse ergeben Latenzfunktionen mitähnlichen Exponenten. Für kurzzeitige Blitze und bei allen untersuchten Reizbedingungen ist die Latenz durch die Reizenergie der ersten 10 msec, des Blitzes bestimmt. Dies gilt unabhängig vom Leuchtdichtenibeau des Blitzes. Die Invarianz der Dauer der zeitlichen Abhängigkeit weist auf einen linearen Process für die Latenzbestimmung hin.

  abstract = {In the antisaccade task subjects are required to suppress the reflexive tendency to look at a peripherally presented stimulus and to perform a saccade in the opposite direction instead. The present studies aimed at investigating the inhibitory mechanisms responsible for successful performance in this task, testing a hypothesis of parallel programming of exogenous and endogenous components: A reflexive saccade to the stimulus is automatically programmed and competes with the concurrently established voluntary programme to look in the opposite direction. The experiments followed the logic of selectively manipulating the speed of processing of these components and testing the prediction that a selective slowing of the exogenous component should result in a reduced error rate in this task, while a selective slowing of the endogenous component should have the opposite effect. The results provide evidence for the hypothesis of parallel programming and are discussed in the context of alternative accounts of antisaccade performance.}

  abstract = {Visual illusions provide a powerful tool for probing the mechanisms that underlie perception. While most previous studies of visual illusions focused on average group-level performance, less attention has been devoted to individual differences in susceptibility to illusions. Unlike in other perceptual domains, in which there are established, validated tools to measure individual differences, such tools are not yet available in the domain of visual illusions. Here, we describe the development and validation of the BTPI (Ben-Gurion University Test for Perceptual Illusions), a new online battery designed to measure susceptibility to the influence of three prominent size illusions: the Ebbinghaus, the Ponzo, and the height–width illusions. The BTPI also measures perceptual resolution, reflected by the just noticeable difference (JND), to detect size differences in the context of each illusion. In Experiment 1 (N = 143), we examined performance in typical self-paced tasks, whereas in Experiment 2 (N = 69), we employed a fixed presentation duration paradigm. High test–retest reliability scores were found for all illusions, with little evidence for intercorrelations between different illusions. In addition, lower perceptual resolution (larger JND) was associated with a larger susceptibility to the illusory effect. The computerized task battery and analysis codes are freely available online.},

The authors evaluated this claim by examining the temporal dynamics of the detection of features and conjunctions. The 1st experiment used a reaction time (RT) task to replicate standard mean RT patterns and to examine the shapes of the RT distributions. The 2nd experiment used the response-signal speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure to measure discrimination (asymptotic detection accuracy) and detection speed (processing dynamics). Set size affected discrimination in both feature and conjunction searches but affected detection speed only in the latter. Fits of models to the SAT data that included a serial component overpredicted the magnitude of the observed dynamics differences. The authors concluded that both features and conjunctions are detected in parallel. Implications for the role of attention in visual processing are discussed.

  abstract = {Are people who are susceptible to one illusion susceptible to others?  Previous research has shown small correlations, but might small values reflect attenuation from measurement error?  Data from 149 participants on 2 variants of 5 illusions were collected using an adjustment paradigm.  The resulting data are of notable high quality inasmuch as there is relatively little within-subject variability and relatively much between-subject variability (\$\textbackslash gamma\textasciicircum 2 \textbackslash approx 1.14\$, reliability \$\textbackslash approx .93\$).  Because the data are of such high quality, correlations may be estimated to high precision.  In line with previous research, these cross-illusion correlations are low in value, about .22\$\textbackslash pm .07\$.  A Bayesian hierarchical analysis reveals that there is almost no attenuation from measurement error in these values.  Though correlations are low, latent variable analysis reveals that the pattern among these correlations yields a single, common latent factor. This factor loads on every illusion and accounts for about 25\textbackslash\% of the variance in each; thus it is a \{\textbackslash em susceptibility to illusions\} factor.  We provide a novel set of statistical and graphical analyses focused on understanding the uncertainty in effects, correlations, and latent variables.},

  abstract = {It is popular to study individual differences in cognition with experimental tasks, and the main goal in such approaches is to analyze the pattern of correlations across a battery of tasks and measures.  One difficulty is that experimental tasks are often low in reliability as effects are small relative to trial-by-trial variability.  Consequently, it remains difficult to accurately estimate correlations.  One approach that seems attractive is hierarchical modeling where trial-by-trial variability and variability across conditions, tasks, and individuals are modeled separately.  Here we show that hierarchical models may reduce the error in estimating correlations up to 46\%, but only if substantive constraint is imposed.  The approach here is Bayesian, and we develop novel Bayesian hierarchical factor models for experiments where trials are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals.  The prior on covariances across tasks can either be unconstrained, in which there is little error reduction, or constrained, in which there is substantial error reduction.  The constraints are: 1. There is a low-dimension factor structure underlying the covariation across tasks; and 2. All loadings are nonnegative leading to a positive manifold on correlations.  We argue that both of these assumptions are reasonable in cognitive domains, and that with them, researchers may profitably use hierarchical models to estimate correlations across tasks in low-reliability settings.},

Model estimation is complicated by the fact that we typically have multiple interdependent response variables and multiple latent variables (which may also be called random effects or hidden variables), often leading to slow and inefficient posterior sampling. In this paper, we describe and illustrate a general, efficient approach to Bayesian SEM estimation in Stan, contrasting it with previous implementations in R package blavaan (Merkle and Rosseel 2018). After describing the approaches in detail, we conduct a practical comparison under multiple scenarios. The comparisons show that the new approach is clearly better. We also discuss ways that the approach may be extended to other models that are of interest to psychometricians.\&lt;/p\&gt;}

The methodology and software are intended to provide users with a general means of estimating Bayesian SEMs, both classical and novel, in a straightforward fashion. Users can estimate Bayesian versions of classical SEMs with lavaan syntax, they can obtain state-of-the-art Bayesian fit measures associated with the models, and they can export JAGS code to modify the SEMs as desired.

  abstract = {Inference from the fitting of linear models is basic to statistical practice, but the development of strategies for analysis has been hindered by unnecessary complexities in the descriptions of such models. Three false steps are identified and discussed: they concern constraints on parameters, neglect of marginality constraints, and confusion between non-centrality parameters and corresponding hypotheses. Useful primitive statistical steps are discussed, and the need for strategies, rather than tactics, of analysis stressed. The implications for the development of good, fully interactive, computing software are set out, and illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {A well known identifiability issue in factor analytic models is the invariance with respect to orthogonal transformations. This problem burdens the inference under a Bayesian setup, where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to generate samples from the posterior distribution. We introduce a post-processing scheme in order to deal with rotation, sign and permutation invariance of the MCMC sample. The exact version of the contributed algorithm requires to solve \$\$2\textasciicircum q\$\$assignment problems per (retained) MCMC iteration, where q denotes the number of factors of the fitted model. For large numbers of factors two approximate schemes based on simulated annealing are also discussed. We demonstrate that the proposed method leads to interpretable posterior distributions using synthetic and publicly available data from typical factor analytic models as well as mixtures of factor analyzers. An R package is available online at CRAN web-page.},

It now provides a choice of interface; users can write scripts in Python if they choose, while those who prefer to construct experiments graphically can use the new Builder interface. Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},

  abstract = {Proper use of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) requires the researcher to make a series of careful decisions. Despite attempts by Floyd and Widaman (1995), Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, and Strahan (1999), and others to elucidate critical issues involved in these decisions, examples of questionable use of EFA are still common in the applied factor analysis literature. Poor decisions regarding the model to be used, the criteria used to decide how many factors to retain, and the rotation method can have drastic consequences for the quality and meaningfulness of factor analytic results. One commonly used approach-principal components analysis, retention of components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and varimax rotation of these components-is shown to have potentially serious negative consequences. In addition, choosing arbitrary thresholds for factor loadings to be considered large, using single indicators for factors, and violating the linearity assumptions underlying EFA can have negative consequences for interpretation of results. It is demonstrated that, when decisions are carefully made, EFA can yield unambiguous and meaningful results.},

  abstract = {In the past decade there has been renewed interest in the study of mental imagery. Emboldened by new findings from neuroscience, many people have revived the idea that mental imagery involves a special format of thought, one that is pictorial in nature. But the evidence and the arguments that exposed deep conceptual and empirical problems in the picture theory over the past 300 years have not gone away. I argue that the new evidence from neural imaging and clinical neuropsychology does little to justify this recidivism because it does not address the format of mental images. I also discuss some reasons why the picture theory is so resistant to counterarguments and suggest ways in which non-pictorial theories might account for the apparent spatial nature of images.},

Yet, establishing correlations among common inhibition tasks such as Stroop or flanker tasks has proven quite difficult. It remains unclear whether this difficulty occurs because there truly is a lack of correlation or whether analytic techniques to localize correlations perform poorly real-world contexts because of excessive measurement error from trial noise. In this paper, we explore how well correlations may localized in large data sets with many people, tasks, and replicate trials. Using hierarchical models to separate trial noise from true individual variability, we show that trial noise in 24 extant tasks is about 8 times greater than individual variability. This degree of trial noise results in massive attenuation in correlations and instability in Spearman corrections. We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks. These hierarchical models also perform poorly in localizing correlations. The advantage of these models is not in estimation efficiency, but in providing a sense of uncertainty so that researchers are less likely to misinterpret variability in their data. We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help localize correlations.},

  abstract = {In his 1956 APA Presidential Address, Lee Cronbach called for a merging of differential and experimental psychology. One main component was the use true experiments from experimental psychology to study individual differences. True experiments had control conditions, and used statistical contrasts to define effects that were free of nuisance variation. Cronbach reasoned that such experimentally defined effects would have greater construct validity than raw performance scores. Cronbach's merger has been repeatedly attempted, but the results have been lackluster, especially for measuring individual differences in cognitive control. Here we show through simulation that the merger is difficult because experimentally-defined contrasts are too noise-prone to be useful at the individual level. As a consequence, it is difficult to uncover even simple latent structures such as clusters or factors. To explore the merger, we provide a new measure of task goodness that is invariant across experiments with different numbers of people and, most importantly, trials. This new measure is a signal-to-noise ratio; how variable people are relative to how variable noise is in repeated trials. We survey the literature to establish typical SNR levels, which are then used in simulations. Latent cluster or factor structures were only recoverable in the largest of experiments comprising hundreds of people each observing hundreds of trials in each condition for each task, and only for the simplest structures. These disappointing results serve as a warning. Although Cronbach's merger is a great idea in theory, it faces substantial hurdles in practice.},

The problem is often called one of reliability: Individual differences in cognitive tasks, especially cognitive-control tasks, seem too unreliable. In this article, we use the language of hierarchical models to define a novel reliability measure—a signal-to-noise ratio—that reflects the nature of tasks alone without recourse to sample sizes. Signal-to-noise reliability may be used to plan appropriately powered studies as well as understand the cause of low correlations across tasks should they occur. Although signal-to-noise reliability is motivated by hierarchical models, it may be estimated from a simple calculation using straightforward summary statistics.},

  abstract = {Bayesian experimental design is a fast growing area of research with many real-world applications. As computational power has increased over the years, so has the development of simulation-based design methods, which involve a number of algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo and approximate Bayes methods, and which have enabled more complex design problems to be solved. This paper provides an overview of the literature on Bayesian experimental design that uses a decision-theoretic approach. The Bayesian framework provides a unified approach for incorporating prior information and/or uncertainties regarding the statistical model with a utility function which describes the experimental aims. In this paper, we provide a general overview on the concepts involved in Bayesian experimental design, and focus on describing some of the more commonly-used Bayesian utility functions and methods for their estimation, as well as a number of algorithms that are used to search over the design space to find the optimal Bayesian design. We also provide some examples from the literature of real-world applications and discuss future directions for Bayesian experimental design.},

  abstract = {How the visual brain integrates temporally dispersed information is an open question. Often, it is assumed that the visual system simply sums light over a certain period of time (e.g. Bloch’s law). However, in feature fusion, information presented later dominates, suggesting complex temporal dynamics that cannot be described by simple energy summation. For example, if two verniers are presented in rapid succession at the same location, they are not perceived individually but they fuse to one single vernier. The perceived offset of the fused vernier is a combination of the offsets of the two presented verniers, with the later one dominating. Here, we show that indeed, Bloch’s law does not hold across verniers in a sequence. However, changes in the luminance of a single vernier can be compensated for by changes in its duration in accordance with Bloch’s law. We present a simple model to demonstrate that these findings can be explained by decaying neural activation.},

  abstract = {The Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive abilities is a comprehensive taxonomy of abilities embedded in multiple overlapping theories of cognition. It provides a common framework and nomenclature for intelligence researchers to communicate their findings. The basic idea of CHC theory is that intelligence is both multidimensional and functionally integrated. In CHC theory, the dimensions of ability have a hierarchical structure, meaning that some have a broader scope than others. At the bottom of the hierarchy are specific abilities, which are tied to a specific task or test. Specific abilities are the only abilities that can be measured directly. Narrow abilities are clusters of highly correlated specific abilities. Broad abilities are clusters of narrow abilities that are mutually more correlated with each other than with abilities in other broad-ability clusters. The chapter defines each of the constructs in CHC theory in terms that clinicians will find useful. It provides some guidance as to which constructs are more central to the theory or have more validity data available. The chapter proposes a number of additions, deletions, and rearrangements in the list of CHC theory abilities. It presents a model of cognition that incorporates the CHC broad abilities as parameters of information processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Statistical modeling is generally meant to describe patterns in data in service of the broader scientific goal of developing theories to explain those patterns. Statistical models support meaningful inferences when models are built so as to align parameters of the model with potential causal mechanisms and how they manifest in data. When statistical models are instead based on assumptions chosen by default, attempts to draw inferences can be uninformative or even paradoxical—in essence, the tail is trying to wag the dog. These issues are illustrated by van Doorn et al. (this issue) in the context of using Bayes Factors to identify effects and interactions in linear mixed models. We show that the problems identified in their applications (along with other problems identified here) can be circumvented by using priors over inherently meaningful units instead of default priors on standardized scales. This case study illustrates how researchers must directly engage with a number of substantive issues in order to support meaningful inferences, of which we highlight two: The first is the problem of coordination, which requires a researcher to specify how the theoretical constructs postulated by a model are functionally related to observable variables. The second is the problem of generalization, which requires a researcher to consider how a model may represent theoretical constructs shared across similar but non-identical situations, along with the fact that model comparison metrics like Bayes Factors do not directly address this form of generalization. For statistical modeling to serve the goals of science, models cannot be based on default assumptions, but should instead be based on an understanding of their coordination function and on how they represent causal mechanisms that may be expected to generalize to other related scenarios.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are used in situations where a number of characteristics (covariates) affect a nonnormal response variable and the responses are correlated due to the existence of clusters or groups. For example, the responses in biological applications may be correlated due to common genetic factors or environmental factors. The clustering or grouping is addressed by introducing cluster effects to the model; the associated parameters are often treated as random effects parameters. In many applications, the magnitude of the variance components corresponding to one or more of the sets of random effects parameters are of interest, especially the point null hypothesis that one or more of the variance components is zero. A Bayesian approach to test the hypothesis is to use Bayes factors comparing the models with and without the random effects in question—this work reviews a number of approaches for estimating the Bayes factor. We perform a comparative study of the different approaches to compute Bayes factors for GLMMs by applying them to two different datasets. The first example employs a probit regression model with a single variance component to data from a natural selection study on turtles. The second example uses a disease mapping model from epidemiology, a Poisson regression model with two variance components. Bridge sampling and a recent improvement known as warp bridge sampling, importance sampling, and Chib's marginal likelihood calculation are all found to be effective. The relative advantages of the different approaches are discussed.},

In 6 experiments, participants searched for a conjunction target among displays consisting of various proportions of 2 distractor types. Smaller-group search was more prevalent than target-feature search with denser displays and with features that were highly discriminable. Explicit instructions to limit search to a specific feature affected performance only when the discriminability of the guiding feature was much greater than the other target feature. Together, these experiments show that bottom-up factors have more influence in guiding conjunction searches than previously thought. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for the multisample factor analysis model with continuous and polytomous variables. Joint Bayesian estimates of the thresholds, the factor scores and the structural parameters subjected to some simple constraints across groups are obtained simultaneously. The Gibbs sampler is used to produce the joint Bayesian estimates. It is shown that the conditional distributions involved in the implementation are the familiar uniform, gamma, normal, univariate truncated normal and Wishart distributions. The Bayes factor is introduced to test hypotheses involving constraints among the structural parameters of the factor analysis models across groups. Two procedures for computing the test statistics are developed, one based on the Schwarz criterion (or Bayesian information criterion), while the other computes the posterior densities and likelihood ratios by means of draws from the appropriate conditional distributions via the Gibbs sampler. The empirical performance of the proposed Bayesian procedure and its sensitivity to prior distributions are illustrated by some simulation results and two real‐life examples.},

A critical review of previous and present studies showed that no conclusive results could be obtained. Experiments were confined to testing the sensory discrimination of hearing, sight and touch, using the monochord, a graduated series of colored cards, and a graduated series of weights constructed on Galton's cartridge pattern, respectively, for the three conditioned. Five series of experiments were conducted involving varying number of Ss. The results indicated that all branches of intellectual activity possess in common one fundamental function, whereas the remaining or specific elements of the activity seem to be wholly different from that in all the others. In adult life no difference between the two sexes was observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Decision-making behavior is often understood using the framework of evidence accumulation models (EAMs). Nowadays, EAMs are applied to various domains of decision-making with the underlying assumption that the latent cognitive constructs proposed by EAMs are consistent across these domains. In this study, we investigate both the extent to which the parameters of EAMs are related between four different decision-making domains and across different time points. To that end, we make use of the novel joint modelling approach, that explicitly includes relationships between parameters, such as covariances or underlying factors, in one combined joint model. Consequently, this joint model also accounts for measurement error and uncertainty within the estimation of these relations. We found that EAM parameters were consistent between time points on three of the four decision-making tasks. For our between-task analysis, we constructed a joint model with a factor analysis on the parameters of the different tasks. Our two-factor joint model indicated that information processing ability was related between the different decision-making domains. However, other cognitive constructs such as the degree of response caution and urgency were only comparable on some domains.},

  abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We consider the properties of the associated likelihood function, giving an EM algorithm for estimating the principal subspace iteratively, and discuss, with illustrative examples, the advantages conveyed by this probabilistic approach to PCA.},

  abstract = {Many mental tasks that involve operations on a number of items take place within a few hundred milliseconds. In such tasks, whether the items are processed simultaneously (in parallel) or sequentially (serially) has long been of interest to psychologists. Although certain types of parallel and serial models have been ruled out, it has proven extremely difficult to entirely separate reasonable serial and limitedcapacity parallel models on the basis of typical data. Recent advances in theory-driven methodology now permit strong tests of serial versus parallel processing in such tasks, in ways that bypass the capacity issue and that are distribution and parameter free. We employ new methodologies to assess serial versus parallel processing and find strong evidence for pure serial or pure parallel processing, with some striking apparent differences across individuals and interstimulus conditions.},

  abstract = {A growing number of researchers have advocated for the advancement of cognitive neuroscience by blending cognitive models with neurophysiology. The recently proposed joint modeling framework is one way to bridge the gap between the abstractions assumed by cognitive models and the neurophysiology obtained by modern methods in neuroscience. Despite this advancement, the current method for linking the two domains is hindered by the dimensionality of the neural data. In this article, we present a new linking function based on factor analysis that allows joint models to grow linearly in complexity with increases in the number of neural features. The new linking function is then evaluated in two simulation studies. The first simulation study shows how the model parameters can be accurately recovered when there are many neural features, that mimics real-world applications. The second simulation shows how the new linking function can (1) properly recover a representation of the data generating model, even in the case of model misspecification, and (2) outperform the previous linking function in a cross-validation test. We close by applying a model equipped with the new linking function to real-world data from a perceptual decision making task. The model allows us to understand how differences in the model parameters emerge as a function of differences in brain function across speed and accuracy instruction.},

  abstract = {Experimental psychologists often neglect the poor psychometric properties of the dependent measures collected in their studies. In particular, a low reliability of measures can have dramatic consequences for the interpretation of key findings in some of the most popular experimental paradigms, especially when strong inferences are drawn from the absence of statistically significant correlations. In research on unconscious cognition, for instance, it is commonly argued that the lack of a correlation between task performance and measures of awareness or explicit recollection of the target stimuli provides strong support for the conclusion that the cognitive processes underlying performance must be unconscious. Using contextual cuing of visual search as a case study, we show that given the low reliability of the dependent measures collected in these studies, it is usually impossible to draw any firm conclusion about the unconscious character of this effect from correlational analyses. Furthermore, both a psychometric meta-analysis of the available evidence and a cognitive-modeling approach suggest that, in fact, we should expect to see very low correlations between performance and awareness at the empirical level, even if both constructs are perfectly related at the latent level. Convincing evidence for the unconscious character of contextual cuing and other effects will most likely demand richer and larger data sets, coupled with more powerful analytic approaches.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Piéron’s Law is a psychophysical regularity in signal detection tasks that states that mean response times decrease as a power function of stimulus intensity. In this article, we extend Piéron’s Law to perceptual two-choice decision-making tasks, and demonstrate that the law holds as the discriminability between two competing choices is manipulated, even though the stimulus intensity remains constant. This result is consistent with predictions from a Bayesian ideal observer model. The model assumes that in order to respond optimally in a two-choice decision-making task, participants continually update the posterior probability of each response alternative, until the probability of one alternative crosses a criterion value. In addition to predictions for two-choice decision-making tasks, we extend the ideal observer model to predict Piéron’s Law in signal detection tasks. We conclude that Piéron’s Law is a general phenomenon that may be caused by optimality constraints.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Response inhibition is essential for navigating everyday life. Its derailment is considered integral to numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, and more generally, to a wide range of behavioral and health problems. Response-inhibition efficiency furthermore correlates with treatment outcome in some of these conditions. The stop-signal task is an essential tool to determine how quickly response inhibition is implemented. Despite its apparent simplicity, there are many features (ranging from task design to data analysis) that vary across studies in ways that can easily compromise the validity of the obtained results. Our goal is to facilitate a more accurate use of the stop-signal task. To this end, we provide 12 easy-to-implement consensus recommendations and point out the problems that can arise when they are not followed. Furthermore, we provide user-friendly open-source resources intended to inform statistical-power considerations, facilitate the correct implementation of the task, and assist in proper data analysis.},

  abstract = {Twelve right-handed men performed two mental rotation tasks and two control tasks while whole-head functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied. Mental rotation tasks implied the comparison of different sorts of stimulus pairs, viz. pictures of hands and pictures of tools, which were either identical or mirror images and which were rotated in the plane of the picture. Control tasks were equal except that stimuli pairs were not rotated. Reaction time profiles were consistent with those found in previous research. Imaging data replicate classic areas of activation in mental rotation for hands and tools (bilateral superior parietal lobule and visual extrastriate cortex) but show an important difference in premotor area activation: pairs of hands engender bilateral premotor activation while pairs of tools elicit only left premotor brain activation. The results suggest that participants imagined moving both their hands in the hand condition, while imagining manipulating objects with their hand of preference (right hand) in the tool condition. The covert actions of motor imagery appear to mimic the “natural way” in which a person would manipulate the object in reality, and the activation of cortical regions during mental rotation seems at least in part determined by an intrinsic process that depends on the afforded actions elicited by the kind of stimuli presented.},

  abstract = {In comparison to young adults, middle-aged and old people show lower scores in intelligence tests and slower response times in elementary cognitive tasks. Whether these well-documented findings can both be attributed to a general cognitive slow-down across the life-span has become subject to debate in the last years. The drift diffusion model can disentangle three main process components of binary decisions, namely the speed of information processing, the conservatism of the decision criterion and the non-decision time (i.e., time needed for processes such as encoding and motor response execution). All three components provide possible explanations for the association between response times and age. We present data from a broad study using 18 different response time tasks from three different content domains (figural, numeric, verbal). Our sample included people between 18 to 62 years of age, thus allowing us to study age differences across young-adulthood and mid-adulthood. Older adults generally showed longer non-decision times and more conservative decision criteria. For speed of information processing, we found a more complex pattern that differed between tasks. We estimated mediation models to investigate whether age differences in diffusion model parameters account for the negative relation between age and intelligence, across different intelligence process domains (processing capacity, memory, psychometric speed) and different intelligence content domains (figural, numeric, verbal). In most cases, age differences in intelligence were accounted for by age differences in non-decision time. Content domain-general, but not content domain-specific aspects of non-decision time were related to age. We discuss the implications of these findings on how cognitive decline and age differences in mental speed might be related.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.

  abstract = {Top-down control of responses is a key construct in cognitive science that is thought to be critical for self-control. It is typically measured by subtracting performance in experimental conditions in which top-down control is theoretically present against performance in matched conditions in which it is assumed to be absent. Recently, however, subtraction-based metrics of top-down control have been criticized for having low test-retest reliability, weak intercorrelations, and little relation to self-report measures of self-control. Concurrently, there is growing evidence that task-general cognitive efficiency, indexed by the drift rate parameter of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978), constitutes a cohesive, reliable individual difference dimension relevant to self-control. However, no previous studies have directly compared latent factors for top-down control (derived from subtraction metrics) with factors for task-general efficiency “head-to-head” in the same sample in terms of their cohesiveness, temporal stability, and relation to self-control. In this re-analysis of a large open data set (Eisenberg et al., 2019; N~=~522), we find that top-down control metrics fail to form cohesive latent factors, that the resulting factors have poor temporal stability, and that they exhibit tenuous connections to questionnaire measures of self-control. In contrast, cognitive efficiency measures—drawn from conditions of the same tasks that both are, and are not, assumed to demand top-down control—form a robust, temporally stable factor that correlates with questionnaire measures of self-control. These findings suggest that task-general efficiency is a central individual difference dimension relevant to self-control. Moreover, they go beyond recent measurement-based critiques of top-down control metrics, and instead suggest problems with key theoretical assumptions that have long guided this research paradigm.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the higher-order factor model and the hierarchical factor model is explored formally. We show that the Schmid-Leiman transformation produces constrained hierarchical factor solutions. Using a generalized Schmid-Leiman transformation and its inverse, we show that for any unconstrained hierarchical factor model there is an equivalent higher-order factor model with direct effects (loadings) on the manifest variables from the higher-order factors. Therefore, the class of higher-order factor models (without direct effects of higher-order factors) is nested within the class of unconstrained hierarchical factor models. In light of these formal results, we discuss some implications for testing the higher-order factor model and the issue of general factor. An interesting aspect concerning the efficient fitting of the higher-order factor model with direct effects is noted.},

  abstract = {The qCSF has been used to assess spatial vision in normal and clinical populations. Because it uses the log parabola CSF model, the estimated contrast sensitivities (CSs) across different spatial frequencies (SFs) are not independent. Most studies have used the area under Log CSF (AULCSF) to simplify statistical inference. Here, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) with population, individual and test levels to compute the joint posterior CS distribution across all levels and SFs to enable statistical inference on CS at individual SFs, using covariance hyperparameters at the population and individual levels to capture the relationship between CSs across SFs. We applied the HBM to a dataset of 112 subjects tested with qCSF trials in each of three (L, M \&amp; H) luminance conditions (Hou et al., 2016). The HBM recovered correlations between CSs in pairs of 19 SFs (0.739 to 0.948, -0.065 to 0.451, and -0.044 to 0.340 at the population, individual and test levels, respectively), and precise CS estimates at individual SFs for each subject (average 68.2\% HWCI=0.097 log10 units). CS difference distributions between luminance conditions were constructed from the joint posterior distribution. At the group level, luminance had highly significant effects on CS both across 19 SFs jointly and at each SF (all p\&lt;0.001). 112, 111, and 71 subjects exhibited significant luminance effects on CS across 19 SFs jointly in L-H, L-M, and H-M, respectively (p\&lt; 0.05), whereas 112, 112, and 101 subjects exhibited significant luminance effects in at least two SFs (p\&lt;0.05). With covariances, the HBM generated precise CS estimates at individual SFs for each subject based on only 150 optotypes in each condition. The joint posterior distribution from the HBM enabled statistical inference on CS at individual SFs and across SFs at both group and subject levels.},
